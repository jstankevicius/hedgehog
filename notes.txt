What should the database "framework" look like?
--> probably sqlite, but do we want to keep it all in one table?
	The advantage is that we no longer have to deal with 286 separate files,
	and SQL commands are pretty well-documented and Alex can probably use them
	without much trouble if he wants to do data analysis.

	You should easily be able to tell the database whether or not you want
	data fetched for one company, for a list of companies, or for all of them.
	The program should then tell you how many changes would be written to
	the database, and you should be able to "push" the data to the database
	if you want. The program should also tell you if any companies should be
	eliminated from the database because they are no longer on the market.
